# String Concatenation
# Merge variable a with variable b into variable c:

a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + b
print(c)

# To add a space between them, add a " ":

a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + " " + b
print(c)


age = 36
txt = "My name is John, I am " + age

# Create an f-string:

age = 36
txt = f"My name is John, I am {age}"
print(txt)


# Add a placeholder for the price variable:

price = 59
txt = f"The price is {price} dollars"
print(txt)
